# Data Product Development Bootcamp - Day-1

This project contains the Jupyter Notebooks and supporting files for _Data Product Development Bootcamp_ with Max Schultze and Arif Wider. 

These notebooks can be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

To prepare your exercise setup for this training, please go do https://colab.research.google.com/.

When prompted to *Open notebook* (alternatively when clicking on *File* -> *Upload Notebook*)
* select *GitHub* on the left side
* enter *data-mesh-training* into the top search bar
* select *data-mesh-training/day-1* from the *Repository* drop down
* click on the exercise_notebook1.ipynb

It is possible that when executing a cell for the first time, Colab warns you that "This notebook was not authored by Google". Please click on *Run anyway* if you want to proceed.

As part of the notebook you will then clone the remaining repository which contains scripts you will be working with (/scripts), as well as solution files for post training reflection (/solutions).
